# Airgead Banking Investment Growth Calculator

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a collaboration with Airgead Banking, a client of Chada Tech, to create an educational tool for teaching high school students the concepts of fiscal responsibility. The application focuses on demonstrating the power of compound interest through an interactive system, allowing users to see how their investments will grow over time.

The key objective of this project was to develop a C++ application that calculates and displays the growth of an investment over a specified period, both with and without additional monthly deposits. The project meets all the functional requirements provided by Airgead Banking and adheres to industry best practices.

## Features

- **Initial Investment Input**: Users can input the initial amount they plan to invest.
- **Monthly Deposits**: Users can specify additional monthly deposits to be made.
- **Annual Interest Rate**: The application allows the user to input an annual interest rate, which is then converted into a monthly rate for calculations.
- **Investment Period**: Users can specify the number of years for which they want to see the growth of their investment.
- **Investment Growth Calculation**: The application calculates and displays the investment's growth over time, both with and without additional monthly deposits.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application prompts the user for all necessary inputs and displays results in a clear and concise manner.

## Reflection

### Project Summary

This project aimed to solve the problem of teaching students about the long-term benefits of investing and the impact of compound interest on their savings. By allowing users to input various parameters, such as the initial investment amount, monthly deposits, annual interest rate, and the number of years, the application calculates how the investment will grow over time. The results are displayed both with and without additional monthly deposits, helping users understand the difference between the two approaches.

### What Went Well

I was particularly successful in designing a clear and logical flow for the application, ensuring that the user experience was intuitive and easy to follow. The pseudocode I developed was detailed and helped guide the implementation of the C++ code, leading to an efficient and well-organized final product. Additionally, I ensured that the code was well-documented with inline comments, which made it easier to follow and maintain.

### Areas for Improvement

While the code met all functional requirements, there is always room for optimization. One area that could be enhanced is the efficiency of the loops used to calculate the investment growth. By exploring more advanced data structures or algorithms, the performance of the application could be improved, especially for large input values. Additionally, implementing error handling and input validation would make the application more secure and robust against invalid user inputs.

### Challenges and Solutions

One of the most challenging aspects of this project was accurately calculating the compound interest over multiple years, especially when considering the additional monthly deposits. To overcome this, I broke down the problem into smaller, manageable steps and used pseudocode to map out the logic before implementing it in C++. I also leveraged online resources and documentation to ensure that my calculations were correct and efficient.

### Transferable Skills

The skills I developed during this project are highly transferable to other programming projects and coursework. These include designing and implementing algorithms, writing clean and maintainable code, and using object-oriented programming principles in C++. Additionally, the experience of developing a user-friendly application that meets specific functional requirements will be valuable in future projects.

### Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

To make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I followed best practices such as:
- **Modular Code Structure**: The code was organized into functions that each handled specific tasks, making it easier to update or modify specific parts of the application.
- **Descriptive Naming Conventions**: Variables and functions were named clearly and descriptively, improving code readability.
- **Inline Comments**: Comprehensive comments were added throughout the code to explain the logic behind each step, which aids in future maintenance and adaptation.

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your C++ development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code).
3. Compile and run the project.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input your investment details and view the results.

## Conclusion

This project was an excellent opportunity to apply C++ programming skills to a real-world problem, and the resulting application serves as a useful tool for teaching the concept of compound interest. I am proud of the work accomplished and look forward to applying the skills learned in future projects.
