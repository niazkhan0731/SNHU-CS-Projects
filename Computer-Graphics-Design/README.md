Throughout this project, I approached designing software by thinking about how real-world objects could be simplified into basic shapes, much like building a Lego version of reality. Instead of focusing on every tiny detail, I focused on how a few well-chosen pieces could capture the overall scene. My design process involved first sketching out the key elements (books and a lamp) and then selecting simple 3D primitives like boxes, cylinders, and cones to represent them. This project helped me craft new design skills such as modular scene planning and the use of minimalistic textures to create depth and realism.

The design tactics I learnedâ€”like breaking down complex objects into fundamental shapesâ€”will definitely help in future projects, whether Iâ€™m building larger scenes or even designing user interfaces. It taught me that simplicity can still tell a compelling visual story when done thoughtfully.

When it came to developing the program, I treated it like building a stage for a theater performance: lighting, positioning, and camera control were just as important as the models themselves. I experimented with new development strategies such as creating modular classes (SceneManager, ShaderManager, ViewManager) to keep the code organized and easier to maintain. Iteration was a big part of my development process. I constantly tested different lighting setups, texture mappings, and camera movements until everything felt balanced and natural.

Over the milestones, my approach to coding evolved from writing quick, isolated pieces to thinking more about the overall architecture of the project. By the end, I had built a more professional, scalable system instead of a quick prototype.

Computer science, and computational graphics specifically, will help me reach my educational and career goals by giving me the tools to build engaging digital environments. The skills I gained in this project, such as lighting models, camera controls, and scene management, are directly applicable to future pathways, whether that's game development, simulation work, or creating rich visual experiences in technology. Understanding how computational graphics work opens up a whole new layer of technical creativity that I can carry forward into both academic and professional projects.
