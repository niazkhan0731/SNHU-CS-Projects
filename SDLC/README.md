# Final Project: SNHU Travel Application - Software Development Life Cycle

## Overview

This repository contains the final deliverables for the SNHU Travel application project, part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) course. The project involved developing a new booking tool using the Scrum-Agile framework to enhance customer experiences with personalized travel options.

### Project Files
- `Sprint_Review_and_Retrospective.docx`: A comprehensive document summarizing the Sprint Review and Retrospective, detailing the application of Scrum roles, handling of project interruptions, communication strategies, and evaluation of the Agile approach.
- `Agile_Presentation.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation aimed at ChadaTech’s leadership, contrasting Agile and Waterfall methodologies, explaining Agile roles and phases, and discussing decision factors for choosing a development approach.

## Essential Questions

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs involves actively engaging with users to gather their feedback and understand their requirements. In this project, we conducted focus groups and collected input to identify key features for the booking tool. Creating "user stories" allowed us to translate these needs into specific, actionable tasks for the development team. Each user story focused on a particular aspect of the customer experience, such as personalized travel recommendations, ensuring that we addressed real user requirements and delivered a product that aligned with their expectations.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach program development with an emphasis on iterative progress and adaptability. In this project, we used the Scrum-Agile approach, which involved breaking down tasks into manageable increments, allowing for continuous feedback and improvements. Moving forward, I plan to incorporate Agile processes like daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives into my future development work. These practices foster regular communication, facilitate quick adjustments, and enhance team collaboration, leading to more effective and responsive development processes.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means actively contributing to the team’s objectives, communicating clearly and respectfully, and supporting colleagues in achieving common goals. It involves being receptive to feedback, sharing knowledge, and working collaboratively to solve problems. Effective teamwork is crucial for navigating challenges and ensuring the successful completion of projects. A good team member also demonstrates reliability and a commitment to both individual and team success.
