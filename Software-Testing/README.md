# 📚 Portfolio Submission: Software Testing and Quality Assurance

## 📝 Overview
This repository contains selected artifacts from two major projects completed during my coursework. Together, they demonstrate my skills in unit testing, automation, and quality assurance for software development. The projects focus on designing and testing core services (Contact, Task, and Appointment) for a mobile application.

## 📂 Submitted Artifacts

- **Project One**: Contact Service Files
  - 📄 Contact.java
  - 📄 ContactService.java
  - 🧪 ContactTest.java
  - 🧪 ContactServiceTest.java

- **Project Two**: Summary and Reflections
  - 🧠 Project_Two_Summary (this file contains the full reflection)

## 💬 Reflection

### ✅ How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure functionality and security through thorough unit testing using techniques like equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis. I validate positive behaviors and intentionally test edge cases and invalid inputs to catch vulnerabilities early. Defensive programming practices, such as input validation and careful handling of dates and external inputs, also contribute to creating robust and secure software.

### 🎯 How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by carefully studying requirements and translating them into specific behaviors the program must support. For example, the requirements clearly defined constraints on data lengths and formats (like phone numbers being exactly 10 digits), and I made sure these needs were reflected both in my code logic and my test cases. I approach development with the mindset of the user to ensure the software behaves predictably and meets real-world expectations.

### 🛠️ How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design methodically by first understanding the requirements, then modeling the necessary entities and services with clean, maintainable structures. I favor modular design, writing private helper methods for validation and ensuring each class has a single responsibility. Throughout the development process, I continuously test and refactor, treating testing not just as an afterthought but as a core part of design. I focus on building reliable, scalable code that is easy to maintain and extend in the future.
