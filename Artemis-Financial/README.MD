# Artemis Financial Security Reports

## Overview

This repository contains security reports for Artemis Financial, showcasing my ability to perform vulnerability assessments and implement secure coding practices. These reports are part of my portfolio, demonstrating my expertise in cybersecurity and secure software development.

## About Artemis Financial

**Client:** Artemis Financial  
**Industry:** Finance & Banking  
**Project Scope:** Artemis Financial required a thorough **vulnerability assessment** and **secure software development practices** to enhance their system security. Their primary concern was identifying and mitigating security risks in their application to protect sensitive financial data from cyber threats.

## Security Work & Reflection

### **1. Identifying Security Vulnerabilities**
I conducted a **vulnerability assessment** of Artemis Financial’s application, identifying security risks such as **unvalidated input**, **insecure authentication mechanisms**, and **outdated dependencies**. Through thorough testing, I successfully pinpointed weaknesses and recommended mitigation strategies.

### **2. Importance of Secure Coding**
Secure coding prevents cyber threats such as SQL injection, XSS attacks, and unauthorized access. Implementing strong security measures ensures data integrity, protects user information, and strengthens the company’s reputation by preventing breaches.

### **3. Challenges & Key Learnings**
One of the biggest challenges was conducting a **dependency security analysis** to identify outdated or vulnerable libraries. Using **OWASP Dependency-Check**, I successfully flagged and updated insecure dependencies, reducing potential attack surfaces.

### **4. Enhancing Security Layers**
To increase security, I implemented:
- **Input validation** to prevent injection attacks.
- **Role-based authentication (@RolesAllowed)** to restrict access.
- **SSL/TLS encryption** to secure data transmission.
- **Static code analysis** using **OWASP tools** to detect vulnerabilities before deployment.

In future assessments, I would leverage **automated security scanning tools** like **SonarQube** and **Burp Suite** for deeper penetration testing.

### **5. Ensuring Functionality & Security**
After refactoring the code, I performed:
- **Functional testing** to ensure no errors in execution.
- **Security validation** to confirm fixes did not introduce new vulnerabilities.
- **Checksum verification** to confirm the integrity of secure deployments.

### **6. Tools & Resources Used**
- **OWASP Dependency-Check** – Identified and mitigated security risks in dependencies.
- **SecureRandom API** – Ensured strong cryptographic key generation.
- **BasicAuth with SSL/TLS** – Implemented secure authentication and encrypted connections.
- **Static Security Analysis** – Reviewed code manually and through automated tools.

### **7. Showcasing Skills to Employers**
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Conduct **vulnerability assessments** and secure coding practices.
- Utilize **encryption (AES-256, SSL/TLS)** to protect data.
- Implement **authentication and access control mechanisms**.
- Perform **dependency and security risk analysis**.
- Follow **industry-standard best practices (OWASP, NIST guidelines)**.

Employers seeking professionals with **secure software development** expertise can refer to this repository as an example of my **real-world application of security principles**.
