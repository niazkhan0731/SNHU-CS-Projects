# C++ Programming Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my C++ Programming Portfolio! This repository is a showcase of my journey through various computer science courses, where I've applied my skills in C++ programming. Here, you'll find a diverse collection of projects that highlight my ability to solve problems, design efficient algorithms, and write clean, maintainable code.

## Project Structure

The projects in this repository are organized in a consistent manner to ensure clarity and ease of navigation:

- **Source Code (`*.cpp`, `*.h`)**: The core implementation files.
- **Documentation**: Both in-line comments within the code and separate documentation files to explain the projectâ€™s purpose, design, and usage.
- **Pseudocode/Flowcharts**: Planning materials that were used during development.
- **Executable/Build Files**: Compiled binaries (where applicable) to run the programs.
- **Readme**: Each project folder contains its own `README.md` file detailing specific information about the project.

## Reflection

### Problem-Solving and Solution Implementation

Each project in this portfolio was designed to address specific problems or challenges in computer science. My approach to solving these problems involved breaking down the requirements, designing appropriate algorithms, and implementing them using C++.

### Focus on Quality and Maintainability

Throughout these projects, I placed a strong emphasis on writing code that is not only functional but also maintainable and readable. This includes:
- Using clear and descriptive variable names.
- Adhering to consistent coding standards.
- Structuring code in a modular fashion to promote reusability.

### Overcoming Challenges

Complex problems required careful consideration of algorithms and data structures. By leveraging resources such as official C++ documentation and engaging with the programming community, I was able to overcome obstacles and ensure the correctness and efficiency of my solutions.

### Skills and Transferability

The skills I have developed through these projects, including object-oriented programming, debugging, and algorithm design, are applicable to a wide range of software development tasks. These skills will be beneficial in future coursework and professional projects.
