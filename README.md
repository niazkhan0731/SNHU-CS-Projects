## 🪄 Reflection: CS Program Takeaways

### Interpreting User Needs & Implementing Solutions
Every project began with understanding a user’s perspective—whether it was a fictional company like Grazioso Salvare or a systems-level program spec. From user stories to interface design, I’ve translated problem statements into testable, working solutions.

### Agile Thinking & Iterative Development
Using Agile-inspired practices such as iteration, incremental updates, and feedback loops helped me refine my code and manage large project scopes. Tools like Kanban boards and version control enhanced collaboration and clarity.

### Collaboration & Team Contribution
Throughout the program, peer reviews and group feedback helped me become a more effective communicator and problem-solver. I value writing clean, well-documented code that others can easily understand and contribute to.
