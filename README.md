# SNHU Computer Science Projects

## Overview

Welcome to my SNHU Computer Science Projects repository! This repository showcases a diverse collection of projects from various computer science courses I have completed during my studies. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in multiple programming languages and concepts, including but not limited to C++.

## Project Structure

The projects in this repository are organized for clarity and ease of navigation:

- **Source Code**: Core implementation files, including `*.cpp`, `*.h`, and other relevant code files.
- **Documentation**: In-line comments within the code and separate documentation files explaining each project's purpose, design, and usage.
- **Pseudocode/Flowcharts**: Planning materials used during development to visualize and plan solutions.
- **Executable/Build Files**: Compiled binaries (where applicable) to run the programs.
- **Readme**: Each project folder contains its own `README.md` file with detailed information about the specific project.

## Projects

Here you will find various projects categorized by programming language and course. Each project includes:

- **Project Overview**: A brief description of the project's goals and objectives.
- **Code Files**: The source code files for the project.
- **Documentation**: Details on how to use and understand the project.
- **Additional Resources**: Any relevant pseudocode, flowcharts, or executable files.

## Reflection

### Interpreting User Needs and Implementing Solutions

In each project, interpreting user needs involved understanding the problem requirements and translating them into functional solutions. Creating user stories and gathering requirements helped in designing appropriate algorithms and implementing them effectively.

### Approach to Development and Agile Processes

My approach to development involves iterative progress and adaptability. Utilizing Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, has been integral in managing project tasks, incorporating feedback, and improving processes. I aim to continue using these practices in future development work to enhance team collaboration and project outcomes.

### Being a Good Team Member

Being a good team member in software development means contributing effectively, communicating openly, and supporting the team in achieving goals. It involves being proactive, accepting feedback, and collaborating to resolve challenges and ensure project success.
